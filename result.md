Okay, I've reviewed the English (en.json) and Spanish (es.json) language files, and here's my assessment:

**1. Missing Keys:**

*   There are **no missing keys**. Both files contain the exact same keys and nested structure.

**2. Empty Values:**

*   There are **no empty values** in either file. All keys have a corresponding string value.

**3. Placeholder Consistency:**

*   There are **no placeholders** used in these language files, so placeholder consistency is not an issue here.

**4. Potentially Unreasonable/Wrong Translations:**

*   The translation appears to be very good. I do not see any unreasonable or wrong translations.

**Summary:**

The Spanish translation is accurate and complete. It maintains the same structure and keys as the English version. The translations themselves appear appropriate for the context.
